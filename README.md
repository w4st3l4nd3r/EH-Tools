# Networking Tools (C++)

This repository contains networking tools written in modern C++ as part of my path to learning network programming and ethical hacking. These projects have given me an understanding of Layer 2 networking (Ethernet/ARP), sockets, packet structures, byte manipulation and command-line tool development.

## Basics
- TCP Echo
- TCP Multi-client Chatroom
- TCP File Transfer
- Raw ICMP Ping

## Scanners
- ARP-based Network Scanner
- Port Scanner

## Spoofing
- MAC Address Changer
- DNS Spoofer

**Disclaimer:**
These tools are for educational and testing purposes on networks owned by the operator. Do not use them against systems without explicit permission.
